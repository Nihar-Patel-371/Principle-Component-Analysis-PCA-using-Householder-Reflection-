# Principle-Component-Analysis-PCA-using-Householder-Reflection-

■ Principle Component Analysis is technique for dimensional reduction.

■ It helps in summarizing the dataset which has large number of variables by reducing less affecting variables without loss of significant information.

■ There are many dimensional reduction method but PCA is considered on the most effective method.

■ We have used Householder reflection for QR decomposition.
